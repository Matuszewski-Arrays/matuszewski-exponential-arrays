## 1. INTRODUCTION
This document records the successful isolation of three unique "Magic Square" configurations at exponential scales ($2^{64}$, $10^{62}$, and $10^{100}$). While the associative properties of magic squares are well-documented, the specific integer sets generated in this study have effectively zero probability of prior cataloging due to the arbitrary magnitude of the scalars selected.

## 2. METHODOLOGY
The arrays were constructed using linear affine transformations $f(x) = \alpha x + \beta$ applied to standard associative base grids of Order 3 (Lo Shu), Order 4 (Jupiter/Dürer), and Order 5.

* **Instance A (Exa-Scale):** Targeted the limit of 64-bit unsigned integer architecture. $\alpha = 2^{64}$.
* **Instance B (Planck-Cosmic):** Targeted the dimensionless ratio of the Observable Universe diameter to the Planck Length. $\alpha = 10^{62}$.
* **Instance C (Googol-Prime):** Targeted the magnitude of one Googol. $\alpha = 10^{100}$.

## 3. CONCLUSION
These arrays, designated "The Matuszewski Arrays," demonstrate that harmonic additive properties remain stable at cosmic scales. They are hereby released into the public domain for educational and recreational mathematical use.
