### 📜 The Pursuit of Mathematical Harmony

Magic Squares are among the oldest mathematical curiosities in human history. From the ancient Chinese legend of the *Lo Shu* turtle (c. 2200 BCE) to the engravings of Albrecht Dürer, humanity has been fascinated by the idea of a perfect grid where every row, column, and diagonal sums to the exact same constant.

For thousands of years, these were calculated by hand. Today, we ask a new question: **Does this harmonic stability hold when projected to cosmic scales?**

This research isolates three specific arrays balanced at magnitudes previously theoretical:
1.  **The Exa-scale** (2^64)
2.  **The Planck-scale** (10^62)
3.  **The Googol-scale** (10^100)
