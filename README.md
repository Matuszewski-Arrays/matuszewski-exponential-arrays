### 📜 The Pursuit of Mathematical Harmony

Magic Squares are among the oldest mathematical curiosities in human history. From the ancient Chinese legend of the *Lo Shu* turtle (c. 2200 BCE) to the engravings of Albrecht Dürer, humanity has been fascinated by the idea of a perfect grid where every row, column, and diagonal sums to the exact same constant.

For thousands of years, these were calculated by hand. Today, we ask a new question: **Does this harmonic stability hold when projected to cosmic scales?**

This research isolates three specific arrays balanced at magnitudes previously theoretical, verifying **Affine Stability** at the limits of computational arithmetic.

#### The Isolated Arrays
1.  **Exa-Scale (2^64):** A scaled variant of the classic *Lo Shu* (3x3).
2.  **Planck-Scale (10^62):** A scaled projection of *Dürer’s Square* (4x4) with transcendental offsets.
3.  **Googol-Scale (10^100):** A pure scalar projection of the *Magic Square of Mars* (5x5).
